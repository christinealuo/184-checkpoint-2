    <h2>Summary of What We've Accomplished</h2>
    <p>We created 3D models of the virus and the syringe through Maya.</p>
    <p>For the virus, we made a sphere for the base. For the nubs sticking out of the virus, we made the blocky version
      of a single nub and smoothed it with the Catmull Clark smoothing algorithm. The nub is duplicated around the
      sphere.
    </p>
    <p>They don’t have any textures or materials on them for now because we recently figured out how to create the
      models themselves. After creating models in Maya, we figured that the base wireframe for the game requires Unity.
      So, we went to figure out how to create objects, import objects from Maya, include AR starter information, and
      deal with camera issues. After including the object, we ran into a problem where we wanted to instantiate an
      object, but instead of it including the scripts we had on it, it came in with nothing. We looked online and the
      problem was that we created new models, not new prefabs, which are objects that include other information on it,
      such as scripts and colliders. With this, we were able to create prefabs from code and also randomly assign
      locations for them to be in, making every run of the game different. With the scripts, we made them slowly come
      toward the player. Lastly, we added the ray tracing part, which Unity graciously gave us a command. With this, we
      made it so that you could tap and it would tell you if you hit a virus or not. We plan to have many actions
      related to that checker, so this checker was very big.
    </p>
    <p>For tap raytracing, we first detect if the user made a single tap on the screen (holding down does not count). A
      ray with origin at the tapped screen location and with direction perpendicular to the screen is cast from the
      camera. All virus prefabs have the tag “virus.” If the ray hits an object, we check if the object’s tag is
      “virus.” If it is, we have hit a virus. For now, if the user taps on a virus, we just display “tapped on virus!!!”
      to the console. Else, “tapped on nothing.” is displayed on the console.
    </p>
    <h2>Reflect on Progress</h2>
    <p>
      Relative to our initial plan, our progress so far has been according to schedule. In our initial plan, we wanted
      to learn how to use Unity and Maya in order to figure out how to add code to objects and lights and create models,
      which we were able to complete. By the second week, we had planned on finishing up the models of the virus and the
      syringe, which we were also able to complete. We also had planned on creating a basic representation of the
      environment, but we decided that it was more important to implement the basic functionality of the game rather
      than the aesthetics of it so we decided not to focus on the environment for now. Lastly, we had planned on adding
      texture to the virus but we were unable to complete that for the checkpoint.
    </p>
    <h2>Update Work Plan</h2>
    <p>
      The plan now is to add texturing and looks onto next week as well as including killing enemies and a scoreboard.
      Originally, we had planned on creating models of people and adding texture to these people, but we decided that it
      wouldn't be necessary to include people in our game.
